              PyCon Uganda is a community conference intended for networking and
              collaboration in the developer community. We value the
              participation of each member of the Python community and want all
              attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
              Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and
              courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all
              conference events. To make clear what is expected, all staff,
              attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any
              PyCon event are required to conform to the following Code of
              Conduct, as set forth by the Python Software Foundation.
              Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.
